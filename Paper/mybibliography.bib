abstract = {Human-computer interaction is replete with ways of talking about qualities of interaction
or interfaces, including if they are expressive, rich, fluid, or playful. An example
of such a quality is subtle. While this word is frequently used in the literature,
we lack a coherent account of what it means to be subtle, how to achieve subtleness
in an interface, and what theoretical backing subtleness has. To create such an account,
we analyze a sample of 55 publications that use the word subtle. We describe the variants
of subtle interaction in the literature, including claimed benefits, empirical approaches,
and ethical considerations. Not only does this create a basis for thinking about subtleness
as a quality of interaction, it also works to show how to solidify varieties of quality
in HCI. We conclude by outlining some open empirical and conceptual questions about
subtleness.},

abstract = {We propose a sensing technique for detecting finger movements on the nose, using EOG
sensors embedded in the frame of a pair of eyeglasses. Eyeglasses wearers can use
their fingers to exert different types of movement on the nose, such as flicking,
pushing or rubbing. These subtle gestures can be used to control a wearable computer
without calling attention to the user in public. We present two user studies where
we test recognition accuracy for these movements.},

abstract = {In "Itchy Nose" we proposed a sensing technique for detecting finger movements on
the nose for supporting subtle and discreet interaction. It uses the electrooculography
sensors embedded in the frame of a pair of eyeglasses for data gathering and uses
machine-learning technique to classify different gestures. Here we further propose
an automated training and visualization tool for its classifier. This tool guides
the user to make the gesture in proper timing and records the sensor data. It automatically
picks the ground truth and trains a machine-learning classifier with it. With this
tool, we can quickly create trained classifier that is personalized for the user and
test various gestures.},
